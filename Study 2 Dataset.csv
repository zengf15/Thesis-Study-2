TG and I have been a really great team as we've transitioned into being new parents, but naturally, bringing a whole new person in to the mix is going to cause some conflict. Our biggest conflict recently has been regarding how to manage taking care of a baby while also keeping our house somewhat clean and clutter-free. We are sleep deprived, I'm working a full time job, and he's a freelancer. Any time I'm not with IG, he takes her, but being so overworked and tired means that our house cleaning often falls through the cracks. Recently, he shared with me that he's a bit stressed out because there's a lot of clutter around the house and there's really no place that is fully clean. I was a little frustrated with this because I'm working full time and caring for a baby, and I tend to contribute more to house cleaning than he does, but we talked it out and ultimately came to the conclusion that we'd create a daily cleaning schedule. I think the reason we had this conflict was because there's so much change in our life that we were overhwelmed with the smaller tasks involved with cleaning, and making this schedule has already helped us each balance our responsibilities and keep things from being too messy.",5.794,258.25,261.462,7,1,7,1,1,0,10,7,7,6,7,1,2, , , , , ,"The absolute best thing about my relationship is how supportive and caring TG is.
